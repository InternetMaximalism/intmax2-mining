### Comparison between Int1 and Liquidity Contract

- `Deposited` event is the same
- `DepositsAnalyzedAndRelayed` of Liquidity Contract corresponds to `DepositsAnalyzedAndProcessed` of Int1. The difference is that the Liquidity Contract relays the deposits to the Scroll contract, while Int1 processes the deposits itself. Thus `gasLimit` and `message` are not present in the Int1 event.
